## Licence modification...
Australian law requires me to retain my Moral Rights, as asserted by the copyright notice above, so...
This code is on a modified MIT licence, the modification is that it's free to use on an individual by individual basis but, if you are using it in a mass production context, please contact me, at the address above, to negotiate a commercial licence. You'll find I'm quite reasonable and not greedy, but the free licence will remain for hobbyists & makers and is separate from any commercial agreement, and this part cannot be negotiated away.
